At HackerLand University, a passing grade is any grade 40 points or higher on a 100 point scale. Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student’s grade according to the following rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next higher multiple of 5 is less than 3, round to the next higher multiple of 5
If the grade is less than 38, don’t bother as it’s still a failing grade
Automate the rounding process then round a list of grades and print the results.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer denoting  (the number of students). 
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, , denoting student 's grade.

Constraints

Output Format

For each  of the  grades, print the rounded grade on a new line.

Sample Input 0

73
67
38
33
Sample Output 0
